			<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
			<p>A solution to this issue would be to limit the amounts of technology that you use per day.  Most adults can easily remember a time when only the savviest of business men had cellphones.  A study done by researchers from the University of Glasgow revealed that almost half of the studies participants reported checking their email once an hour, while other checked their email 30 to 40 times an hour (Soong).  With this busy society we need to find a balance between work, leisure, and technology.  One suggestion would be to set a time, perhaps once a week where you don’t use the computer or your phone.  This provides a psychological recovery and prevents burnout from the overuse of technology.  It may even feel like a vacation to people constantly tethered to their communication devices.  If that seems too drastic try out a short period where you’re inaccessible.  Leave your phone and go for a peaceful walk, your life won’t self-destruct if you aren't able to communicate twenty-four seven and you can get some exercise.  For children parent’s can easily set timers and programs to limit their use of the Xbox, TV and internet.  This would cause them to hopefully spend more time with people in the real world and improve their personal skills.  A last idea is easy, learn moderation.  Learning moderation and having self-discipline is a skill that would serve anyone well and using it towards technology is a good thing.  Everyone knows that too much of anything isn’t a good thing and technology is no different.
