			<h2>Remix Memo</h2>
			<p>	For the remix project we chose to create a video about the overuse of technology.  The project was based on the topic of some of our cultural analysis papers written in class.  Since our paper were analyzing a certain topic we chose to compose our video in an expository style.  Composing this video in a documentary like style helped us visualize how much we actually use technology on a day to day basis.  At all times we’re connected to the internet either through my cellphone or computer.  The only encounters that occurred were technological errors.  Since none of us were very familiar with making movies or using movie editing software, we had to learn how to use the program in addition to creating a remix video.  Our audience played a small role in how we created our video as we were trying to show people how much of an integral part technology plays in our life.  We chose this topic because we felt that almost everyone watching the video would be able to relate to the topic.  Almost everyone nowadays has access to some sort of electronic device, and almost everyone on a college campus uses technology on a very regular basis.  The most challenging part was actually putting our clips and music together in a fairly cohesive way.  None of us had used any sort of video editing program so figuring out the best way to create the video was very challenging.  We sort of took a systematic approach to our project, initially we wrote up a rough outline of how we wanted our video to flow.  We chose to start our video talking about the younger generation and transitioned it into how our generation uses technology.  The video was laid out like this because we kinda wanted to do a timeline of our lives, starting from a younger generation to our generation.  Youtube was one of the the best research resource to us.  There were a multitude of credible news clips talking about the effects technology has on children, which could also be translated easily to the effects technology use has on adults.  We also had all the research we had done for the actual papers.  The least beneficial research resources to us were the formal research papers we had cited on our papers.  It was very hard to translate the research reports into a video format.  Our group interacted together by meeting in class and discussing how we wanted to layout our video.  We also met outside of class to gather clips to use in our video.  Outside of our group we gathered individual movie clips and I put them together in Windows Movie Maker.  Working with a group was very helpful because everyone knows different people.  This helped our project because our clips were more diverse because everyone had a different viewpoint and we see different things everyday.  Our plan went as well as it could have,  the thanksgiving break messed us up because some people had left early for break and we could not do much filming during that time.  But during our class time our plans worked well, we gathered the necessary clips and properly laid out how we wanted to do our video.  If we had more time we could have set up more personal interviews and gotten more clips of how people use technology in their daily lives.  Also, instead of having text flash across the screen we could have had one of us talk about the clips in order to give a more personal, in depth explanation.   Lastly we could have had overall more content to better explain our point of view and why it’s important to do something about it.  The most effective part of our documentary was the fact that we could show our topic in action.  It was very easy to show people exactly what we were talking about, the overuse of technology.  This allowed people to visualize our topic, and easier see where we were coming from.  We made our design decisions based on how we felt the most effective way to get our point across.  Overall I felt that our video accurately displayed our topic, and what needs to be changed in society.
