			<h2>Blog Post #2</h2>
			<p>In the film The Social Network Mark Zuckerberg uses his online blog to drunkenly write comments about his ex-girlfriend.  Technology play a big part on writing and communication as it allows us to say and do things that we may not do face to face. As seen in a later scene when he confronts her while she is eating, he doesn’t want to say anything rude to her in person, but he was willing to do so online where he didn’t have to immediately deal with the consequences.  In real life you can see evidence of people saying things that I highly doubt they would say to another person’s face.  Take Youtube comments for example, because your real name can be hidden behind an online username, people feel like they can post stuff and not have to deal with the repercussions of their actions.   In the real world if I made rude comments at someone I’ve never met I may get a fist in my face.   </p>
			<p>Technology also allows us to think about our comments before we say them.  For example, if I was having a conversation with someone I’d probably have to come up with responses to their statements almost immediately, but online I could think for minutes to come up with a good response. I think technology is hindering how we interact with each other face to face, too often have I seen a group of people sitting at a lunch table and all of them are on their phones instead of interacting face to face.  Technology has made a profound effect on how we communicate with each other, and currently I don’t think it’s for the better. </p>
			
			<h1>Blog Post #1</h1>
			<p>1. The purpose of this video was to show how the speaker felt about his uncle killing himself.  
			hewanted to show that there is help for people like him and his uncle.  And that life does get
			better</p>
			<p>2. The video attemps to achieve this purpose by using a lot of sensory words to show
			feelings and evoke alot of imagery to make the listener feel something.</p>
			<p>The message starts out by talking about his uncle, then he relates the story with personal 
			parts about himself,  the story flows like a timeline, starting with what happened to his
			uncle then going on about how his uncles story relates to him</p>
			<p>The structure can help me reword and help the flow my story.  Currently my narrative bounces
			all over the place, but I'll move sections around so that the story flows from the past to the
			current</p>
