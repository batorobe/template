			<h1>Blog Post #15</h1>
			<p>Last blog post!  This semester has really flown by, I can honestly remember moving in still.  This class has been interesting, the combination of writing and learning coding was actually not too bad.  I would definetly recommend this class to anyone.  I'll take these skills I've learned and apply them in my life, and knowing HTML/CSS I can put on my resume, so that's another plus.  Last thing I'll talk about is the Ohio State MSU game.  I'm kinda all "writing'd" out if thats a thing, and thinking about the great game thats coming is helping.  I really hope we smack OSU this weekend, that would make my semester.  Go State!</p>

			<p>Remix project over!  This project was kinda nervewracking.  I didn't get all the clips for our video until the day before, which coincidentally lined up with the State/UNC game.  Sidebar,  I was not very happy with how that game went and may have yelled alot outside after watching it.  So I got back around 11:00 and started working on the video.  I stayed up until 1:00 working on it and putting the sound in before I gave up and resolved to finish it in the morning.  The project turned out alright, I wish I had a little more time so I could put a little more polish on it.  Oh well, my group can't expect a masterpiece after giving me their clips so soon before the due date.  At least I got the project done and on time so I guess I can't complain too much.</p>
			<h1>Blog Post #13</h1>
			<p>Thanksgiving break!  I'm not really a big fan of breaks.  I know alot of people love break but I think they're too long.  I miss being able to see my friends pretty much 24/7 and my family can get annoying at times.  But it's good to have a break from most school work.  And by most I mean not Codecademy.  I've been slacking recently and I finally decided to do a majority of the work.  The deeper and more I know about HTML and CSS the more I hate it.  I always seem to forget a semi-colon or how to change the weight of the font and it irritates me.  Overall my website is coming along, I'm more of a minimalist person so I'm trying to have as little as possible while still looking alright and doing it's job.  So far so good</p>
			<h1>Blog Post #12</h1>
			<p>Writing this retrospective project has been helpful.  I got to be able to summarize exactly what I've done and analyze how it's helped my writing.  One surprise was the hybrid aspect.  When my friends took a hybrid WRA all they had to do was submit voice and video clips talking about technology.  Actually learning HTML and CSS has been pretty cool. Being able to build a website from scratch is a useful skill.  I had a vague understanding of HTML from actually viewing source code of pages but now Im starting to learn what each symbol means.  Having a computer background has definately been helpful when learning this stuff.</p>
			<h1>Blog Post #11</h1>
			<p>We're continuing to work on our project and it's been going alright.  Being the sort of techie guy I took it upon myself to learn how to edit videos in Windows Movie Maker.  It's been going alright, its actually not to hard and with the internet I can basically do everything.  My group members are gathering clips of people using technology and finding things on Youtube that could enhance our documentary.  It's actually not been too had of a group experience, considering some of my past groups...  Transforming a paper into a viewable medium is pretty cool,  Im a visual person so learning about a topic this way is much more interesting than reading a paper.</p>
			<h1>Blog Post #10</h1>
			<p>I absolutely despise group projects.  Unless laid our carefully they usually end up with one person doing a lot of the work and the rest just kind of being there.  I'm also not the biggest fan of asking other to join their group.  One group project that I did not mind is taking place this year in my ISS215 class.  We're in a group of 20 but the way we do our work is interesting.  We each have to submit what we contributed to the project so everyone has to pull their own share or else it reflects in their grade.  Hopefully I don't have to do a majority of the work for this project.  We're working in groups of four and I decided to work with a group of three sitting in front of me, they seem smart.  We're going to talk more about our project outside of class, but we laid out a rough outline which makes me have hope</p>
			<h1>Blog Post #9</h1>
                        <p>This ad is not only advertising, Chrysler, but also advertising Detroit as the "Motor City".  Initially they displayed the run-down parts of Detroit, with a Chrysler car driving through.  As the music builds the ad transitions to the nicer parts of Detroit, and talks about how the city is being rebuilt.  They chose Eminem because of his roots and ties to Detroit.  The ad emphasizes the fact that the car was made in the "Motor City" and made in America to appeal to people who want American made stuff. I honestly don't think the lyrics had much to do with the theme of the ad because the song talks about getting only one shot and the ad is talking about a rebirth of Detroit.  The song was chosen because it was Eminem's, it had a good beat, and it's a popular song.</p>
                        
                        <h1>Blog Post #8</h1>
                        <p>Half way done! Is it bad that I'm counting these?  At the time of writing I've hit around 2000 words and I swear I can't write anymore.  I guess I'm going to have to go in-depth more with these things Ive written about.  Ive noticed that that's a problem for me, I try to get the most concise possible wording when I write and that doesn't really lend itself to being able to write a 2700 word essay.  I've learned more about my major which is good, but nothing I didn't already know. I enjoy coding (mostly) and putting together computer pieces but class sometimes kills me.  Oh well, I guess it's the life on an engineer...  Overall this project has been going pretty well, I've found research and trade articles that I find interesting, so hopefully anyone reading my paper with a similar major will also find them interesting.  I wasn't a very big fan of this project.</p>	                     		
                        <h1>Blog Post #7</h1>
                        <p>After figuring out how to setup my Cultural Analysis webpage I got started on my Research Project.  It was pretty much impossible for me to find someone to interview for this paper.  All my professors said that they had been asked previously and were too busy to allow me to interview them.  I also went to ask some of the TA's in my class but they had very erratic schedules as two of them frequently went on seminars to learn and teach.  In the end I settled for some interview I found online on what seemed like reputable sources.  Doing the research for papers actually wasn't too bad.  I had a couple of resources from high school and work that I could use to find research papers and trade articles.  The hardest part of this paper was hitting that 2700 word limit, I don't think Ive ever written something that long.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Post #6</h1>
                        <p>Over a third of the way done with these blogs, while I wasn't a fan of them before and I guess I'm still not a fan of them now, I kind of like putting down my thoughts on "paper".  The challenge this week was coding, again...  As a computer engineer I've had my fair share of wanting to throw my computer against the wall when code didn't work, and HTML was no differnt.  For something with so few lines of code I had the hardest time figuring out how to upload my html files and then design it so that it looked just how I wanted it.  If I had Dreamweaver it would be so much easier!  I used that program in middle school and having a WYSIWYG editor would be a god-send right now  After fiddling with it for a couple of hours I finally got it to work, though I don't really know how... Oh well.</p>
                        <h1>Blog Post #5</h1>
                        <p>The cultural analysis project was also an interesting one.  While I don't watch a lot of TV or movies I listen to alot of music, especially rap.  Now some people have misconceptions about rap, I remember when I was younger I used to think "cant spell crap without rap".  But now I see that it's a form of art.  The lyrical flow and talent some rappers have while promoting an underlying message astonishes me sometimes.  This project made me think about one of the song by one of my favorite rappers, The Instrumental by Kid Cudi.  It was interesting to analyze this song for what is said instead of listening to a good beat and paying attention to the catch hook.  I enjoyed investigating what he meant by each line and analyzing them for hidden meanings. </p>
                        <h1>Blog Post #4</h1>
                        <p>In the film The Social Network Mark Zuckerberg uses his online blog to drunkenly write comments about his ex-girlfriend.  Technology play a big part on writing and communication as it allows us to say and do things that we may not do face to face. As seen in a later scene when he confronts her while she is eating, he doesn’t want to say anything rude to her in person, but he was willing to do so online where he didn’t have to immediately deal with the consequences.  In real life you can see evidence of people saying things that I highly doubt they would say to another person’s face.  Take Youtube comments for example, because your real name can be hidden behind an online username, people feel like they can post stuff and not have to deal with the repercussions of their actions.   In the real world if I made rude comments at someone I’ve never met I may get a fist in my face.   </p>
                        <p>Technology also allows us to think about our comments before we say them.  For example, if I was having a conversation with someone I’d probably have to come up with responses to their statements almost immediately, but online I could think for minutes to come up with a good response. I think technology is hindering how we interact with each other face to face, too often have I seen a group of people sitting at a lunch table and all of them are on their phones instead of interacting face to face.  Technology has made a profound effect on how we communicate with each other, and currently I don’t think it’s for the better. </p>
                        
                        <h1>Blog Post #3</h1>
                        <p>First project.  The "Lived Experiences Project"...  While I love to read stories, my favorite kind being science fiction, I'm not very accustomed to writing a narrative.  In highschool I spent alot of time writing research papers and such.  I never really took the time to take that creative writing class which my friends talked highly about.  Being used to writing technical papers I initially found it hard to fill the necessary word count.  But as I got more and more into it, it was easy to hit 1200.  This was interesting.</p>
                        
                        <h1>Blog Post #2</h1>
                        <p>1. The purpose of this video was to show how the speaker felt about his uncle killing himself.  
                        hewanted to show that there is help for people like him and his uncle.  And that life does get
                        better</p>
                        <p>2. The video attemps to achieve this purpose by using a lot of sensory words to show
                        feelings and evoke alot of imagery to make the listener feel something.</p>
                        <p>The message starts out by talking about his uncle, then he relates the story with personal 
                        parts about himself,  the story flows like a timeline, starting with what happened to his
                        uncle then going on about how his uncles story relates to him</p>
                        <p>The structure can help me reword and help the flow my story.  Currently my narrative bounces
                        all over the place, but I'll move sections around so that the story flows from the past to the
                        current</p>
                        <h1>Blog Post #1</h1>
                        <p>First blog post ever in my life.  It's nice to see that I still have first's.  Even at 19 I've done so little.  It's weird to think that at the end of this semester college will almost be halfway done for me.  Another first, this is my first WRA class,  I'm curious as to what the hybrid refers to.  My friends took this class last year and said it wasn't too bad so I hope this will be the same.  Here's to another college semester.</p>
