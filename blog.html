			<p>1. The purpose of this video was to show how the speaker felt about his uncle killing himself.  
			hewanted to show that there is help for people like him and his uncle.  And that life does get
			better</p>
			<p>2. The video attemps to achieve this purpose by using a lot of sensory words to show
			feelings and evoke alot of imagery to make the listener feel something.</p>
			<p>The message starts out by talking about his uncle, then he relates the story with personal 
			parts about himself,  the story flows like a timeline, starting with what happened to his
			uncle then going on about how his uncles story relates to him</p>
			<p>The structure can help me reword and help the flow my story.  Currently my narrative bounces
			all over the place, but I'll move sections around so that the story flows from the past to the
			current</p>
