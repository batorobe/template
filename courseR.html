			<h3>A Course Retrospective of WRA110</h3>
			<p>	Each project worked on during my semester taking WRA 110 has had a distinct effect on my writing style.  In order to better discern how my writing has evolved throughout this past semester I took a look at some of my work from high school.  My work, especially the papers from early high school, was rough to say the least.  There wasn’t really any structure to the papers, research done wasn’t very indepth and the prose was generally sloppy.  As I viewed my papers in chronological order it wasn’t until I viewed my papers written this year that I had seen a growth from my work in high school.  A lot of my shortcomings in writing and research were addressed through the projects worked on in this class.  This class was a hybrid class which meant there was an online section to supplement the class.  So in addition to writing we learned was how to integrate technology with writing through the use of a website.  We took lessons over a website called Codecademy  that taught us the basics on using HTML and CSS.  Initially, our professor gave us a template to use to get us started, but as the semester went on we had to make the website our own through what we learned on Codecademy. At the end of the semester I had a fully-functional website that I had coded by myself.   As an engineer this class was very helpful because it taught me to be a better writer and surprisingly a better programmer.</p>
	<p>During the lived experience project I described one of the pieces of technology that drove me to become a computer engineer.   The paper I wrote talked about what exactly caused my interest in my major, and how much of an impact one object had on my future.  After talking about the object I explored more in depth what pursuing my major would entail.  Going into college I had only the vaguest idea of what I would be doing after college, hopefully working for some engineering firm or consulting.  But writing this paper I firmly realized that I could develop things that actually help people and this paper definitely solidified my decision to pursue my major.  Causing me to research in depth exactly what kind of skills I’d learn and what those skills can be applied to not only helped my research skills, but made me happier with my decision.  Writing this narrative helped my writing skills by forcing me to write in a form that I never had to before.  Coming from my engineering background most of the paper’s I’ve had to write have been technical reports and expository papers, writing this paper has helped my writing flow better.  The style in which I wrote was different which made me think more about how to describe situations and elaborating on scenarios versus promptly detailing how an experiment worked.</p>
	<p>The cultural analysis paper was more of what I was used to.  It had a definite structure and was most like the papers I had written for high school and previous college classes.  The thoughtful analysis I provided was similar to one I may have to provide to a future employer in the workplace.  The way that the proposal was designed helped me learn what kind of writing and research I’d have to employ when writing a proposal similar to this in the future  We were tasked to take some piece of pop culture like a song or movie and discuss how it affected society.  It wasn’t until I looked at the lyrics of some popular songs that I realized that all the songs have some kind of underlying message they’re trying to put out.  I chose the song “The Instrumental” by rapper Lupe Fiasco.  The song talks about youth’s obsession with electronic media, specifically television.  He talks about the effects of addiction and the negative side effects it causes.  This assignment forced me to take a birds-eye view of media and listen to it for what it’s actually saying instead of the catchy hook and good beat.</p>
	<p>The third paper we worked on was the longest and most rigorous. We had to write a research paper about our discipline and talk about the ways professionals communicate knowledge and practice this. In the paper you’re forced to research scholarly articles, trade publications and use personal interviews to supplement your paper.  The formal research project greatly improved my research skills, something that will serve me greatly in my future career as an engineer. This paper was important due to the fact that I had really no idea of what kind of research I was going to do in my future career.  This paper exposed me to the different types of papers put out by not only researchers, but journalists and respected professors and teachers. I learned how the different forms of media are used to communicate knowledge between people.  This paper is very beneficial as you get to learn about the different paths you could take after leaving college and you get to talk about them with professors and people practicing in the field right now.</p>
`	<p>After the research project we had to “remix” one of our previous projects in a group.  By remix I mean transform our paper into a different medium.  In a group we chose one paper to turn into a seven-nine minute documentary.  This helped me learn to be more creative because it was something I had never done before.  No one in my group had any experience filming or editing videos, beside short vines, so we had to learn how within two weeks.  We had to film and put together a cohesive video that would be interesting to watch and learn from.  The most enjoyable part of this project was actually capturing the footage.  Our paper talked about the high use of technology in today’s society so we stood on a sidewalk and taped people on their phones, listening to iPods, and some were even browsing their iPad! It was interesting to see how many people didn’t have their ear plugs plugged in or their phone out texting.  One of the hardest parts about this project was working in a group.  Not only did people live in different parts of East Lansing, we had to coordinate times when everyone was free to work on the project.  Thankfully, we all had time to get together and work on our project, the Thanksgiving break also helped because it allowed us to get footage from our hometown which provided a different perspective than filming on a college campus.  Overall this assignment was fun because it taught me film editing and let us meet new people in the class.</p>
	<p>In addition to all the projects, like I said in the introduction we had in-class assignments and Codecademy to work on. Both of these were very informative.  As a computer engineer I need to learn a multitude of computer languages to succeed in my future career.  Before this class I had never heard of Codecademy, but now I may use it to learn other languages such as Ruby and PHP.  Codecademy was very easy to use, it taught you step by step the basics on how websites were made.  It started with basic paragraph tags and by the end you were learning how to divide your webpage up and design beautiful CSS pages.  The website was also nice because it gave you points for completing lessons and kept track of them.  This was nice because I like getting visual feedback of finishing work and getting trophies is always fun, even if they’re only virtual.  I also enjoyed watching The Social Network in class, I had never seen it before.  It was interesting how they talked about the effect technology has on communication and how it can improve and degrade it.  They also talked about Mark Zuckerberg’s personal story and how he ended up dropping out of college to become a multi-millionaire.</p>
<p>This hybrid writing class was very different from what I’ve taken before.  It only met once a week which was nice, and the workload wasn’t too heavy if you kept up as the course went on. The projects were very doable in the time allotted and they definitely have an impact on your writing, even if it’s just extra practice.  Each project made think about something from a perspective different than my own, something I think would be very beneficial to almost everyone.  The hybrid part of the class, integrating technology, was an interesting addition to a standard writing class and definitely improved on the quality of the class. I had been meaning to learn HTML and CSS before and this class gave me the kick in the rear to do it.  The additional learning of the use of technology almost makes me think this should be a five credit class, two-three for what we learned from writing and one-two for the technological component.  Overall, if you want to take a writing class and are a fan of science/technology I highly recommend taking this class.
