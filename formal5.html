                        <h1>Teacher Interview</h1>
                        <p>The perspective a computer science teacher offers into the paths an engineer can take is just as invaluable as a researchers.  Much like the difference between refereed and trade publications, there exists a difference between researchers and teachers.  Researchers mainly use high level ideas to describe their work, while teachers have to sort of “dumb” the material down to teach it to the students.  A lot of teachers start out as math and science teachers but when they see a lack of qualified teachers at public schools they  take a couple classes at a local college and can easily switch their focus and teach those courses. For example, Garth Flint an educator in Montana got his start as educator by showing a little bit of knowledge about an old computer system.(Flint) Originally Flint started his career as a math teacher at a local high school.  As more and more kids started using computers in the math classes he was teaching, the demand for kids wanting to learn how to program increased.  So he started teaching computer science classes.  He states that “college and high school students can learn by rote, but they cannot seem to learn how to troubleshoot or locate troubleshooting resources” something that I see is true in my current studies.  Being able to communicate knowledge so that novices can understand it is an underrated ability.  As mainly a math teacher Flint has found it hard to teach students the material in different ways, and has focused on more of a teach yourself with my guidance method of teaching.  Unlike math, computer science is constantly evolving, meaning the instructors have to stay on the forefront of teaching the subject.
