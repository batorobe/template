                        <h1>Current Researcher Interview</h1>
                        <p>	Another perspective on how information is communicated can be obtained from someone currently researching within this field.  It was extremely hard to get a professor to respond to an email so I found a couple of interview online between popular researchers and current professors in this field. Professor Jh He, a “rising star in the field of computer science” has written over 137 papers and is the Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Nonlinear Sciences and Numerical Simulation. (He).  Dr. He, who graduated from Shanghai University, has worked on a multitude of projects with others such as new devices for producing nanofibers, allometric scaling, and devising new analytical methods for nonlinear equations.  A lot of his work deals with something called homotopy perturbation method, a method that can be used to solve nonlinear equations and a multitude of other equations.  As a researcher most of his work has no real use to the common public, but to other researchers his work can help them advance their own projects.  Like most other researchers, and as evidenced in the refereed material outlined above, the research done has almost no immediate impact on our day to day lives.  The impact occurs after the research is purposed into a way we can use.  This is true with most other science research.  Most of the communication of research occurs between researchers, not between researchers and the general public.  The material discussed is too complex to be “dumbed” down so that some random person on the street would be able to understand it, so the material is left as is and published in a journal.  One would never see material like this in USA Today or the Wall Street Journal.  The way research material is written clearly reflects the audience it’s meant for.
