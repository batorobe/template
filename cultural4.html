			<h3>Description of Issue</h3>
			<p>While technology has provided us with alot of advances, the recent elevated use of it has had detrimental effects on our society.  One of the side effects technology has had on our society is the lack of physical  activity and a decrease in the healthiness of the food we eat. Hundreds of years ago humans had to physically hunt down animals in order to eat, but as food becomes more readily available countries diets shift from lack of food towards an American-esque feast.   With more and more advances in technology come labor-saving machines.  These machines decrease the amount of physical activity we have to do in order to survive which in turn accelerates the rate at which obesity is rising.  Advances in technology also lead to more people being sedentary and less people being active outdoors.  For example, in South Korea TV viewing time has risen 72 percent from 1983 to 2001 (Choi, Cho, Park, Jang, Park, Kim & Lee, 2006).  Increased technology has also led to easier methods of transportation.  More and more people are buying care and less are using healthier forms of transportation like bikes and walking.  Adults aren't the only ones affected by the increases in technology, more and more kids are spending time playing online video games and using social networks at an alarming rate.  On average 8-18 year olds spend on average 7 hours and 38 minutes daily using entertainment media ("Generation m2: Media," ).  With kids spending their time using a lot of technology they don’t have the time to learn about healthy habits that they need.   The American Academy of Pediatrics tells us that children’s total entertainment media time should not exceed two hours daily, a limit that is on average being beaten by over twice as much time.  If we used technology to further people’s knowledge about healthier eating and exercise habits we could effectively decrease obesity rates across the world.  The increased use of technology has also increased the pace at which we live life at.  My parent’s and I’m sure my parents parents, have told their children that “patience is a virtue”.  A hundred years ago, it was common for it to take weeks to communicate with people halfway across the state.  Now we can send a text message and expect a reply within minutes.  This has led to a decrease in patience in everyone.  Everyone wants instant gratification and lack of patience and determination detrimental to our personal lives.  Another negative effect technology has had is on the declining writing skills of many children.  The high use of chatting shortcuts like “lol” and “omg” have caused the writing and speaking skills of children to decline dramatically.  Not only do kids become worse spellers, they won’t know how to properly use grammar or even be able to sign their own names on a check. The constant use of abbreviations and slang can lead us to forget how to properly use grammar and can degrade our abilities to speak formally ("Is technology harming," 2010).  Kids are relying more and more on digital forms of communication and they don’t have the time, or want to learn how to properly write.   The increase in technological communication affects our ability to express our ideas, especially if we needed to formally tell them to an employer or teacher.  The inability to properly express ourselves in the correct way does not help our society advance as a whole.  Technology also decreases our ability to deal with interpersonal conflicts.  It’s very easy to send people texts or Facebook messages when we’re angry with them instead of confronting them in the real world.  The anonymity the internet gives us allows some people to say things that they would never dream of in real life.  This lead to an increase in rudeness and aggression on online message boards such as the comments on a YouTube video.  This increase in the use of technology could eventually lead to people not even talking to each other face to face anymore, like in the movie Wall-E. Technology decreases the amount of time we spend in personal relationships.  With adults and even children being constantly wired we lose the connection we get from meeting and seeing people face to face. We lose out on facial expressions and other subtle nuances only used when talking to someone face to face.  Humans were built to have contact with other human beings and the increase in the use of technology doesn’t help us achieve that.  But there are ways that we can still use technology and lead healthy lives.</p>
