                        <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
                        <p>	Research occurs within all academic disciplines from 18th century history to astrophysics. Computer engineering is no different.  The research computer engineers and scientists engage in involves topics like algorithms to speed up the rate at which search engines work, how to program artificial intelligence to make tasks easier and ways to make objects such as circuits and transistors, smaller and more efficient.  In a nutshell computer engineers, and to a very large extent computer scientists, work to optimize and improve current technology.  As a student within this discipline writing this paper has taught me about how research works and what kinds of things I may expect to work on after graduating from college. I’ve learned that while computer engineering and computer science are two different disciplines, they could not be more closely intertwined.  During my research for this paper I browsed multiple scholarly journals such as the Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences and the Journal of Computer Engineering & Information Technology.  Browsing through these journals gave me a strong sense of what kinds of research is currently being done, and what has been done in the past.  My research for this paper also brought me to multiple trade websites/magazines which deal with technology and popular gadgets like ArsTechnica and Wired.  These trade magazines provided a different perspective on how information is presented.  While they’re two different sources, the research provided in both the refereed and trade material was very similar.  In addition to written sources, I’ve gathered various oral sources from researchers, professors, and engineers currently practicing.  The added perspective from the researchers helped me learn better about how the research is done, and what kind of environment can be expected when graduating from college.  This different perspective on how communication occurs not just from researchers to the general public, but between researchers and each other has improved my understanding on how communication is done.. In order to better explain how communication and research occurs within my discipline I’ve chosen a couple of articles from both refereed and trade material to discuss.</p>
