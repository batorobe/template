			<h3>Engineer Interview</h3>
			<p>A third perspective can be gained from an actual engineer on the job, someone who utilizes all the information gained by researchers. Jim Amweg is a software engineer at Silent Power in Baxter, Minnesota who works on designing, implementing, and testing embedded code. (Amweg)  Amweg got his start right after leaving the Navy by studying computer science and getting his foot in the door by working for a small consulting company.  Amweg currently heads the software/firmware development for the OnDemand energy appliance projects.  What that means is that heâ€™s basically the manager for his project so he makes recommendations and decisions about the architecture and functionality.  His job is very hectic, working eight to 14 hours doing various jobs such as designing, coding and providing guidance.  He has a B.S. in math and a M.S. in computer science, making him more than qualified for this job.  Much of the code is written with Microsoft Visual Studio and C#.  Communication is a very important skill, especially in a job as a manager because you have to be able to let other people know your ideas in a clear and concise way, much like a teacher, but you still have to be able to understand high level topics like a researcher.  In a way working in the field as an engineer is part of both worlds.  Amweg has to keep up on current technological advances pertaining to his project, which is done by reading research papers and talking with fellow managers who work with similar projects.  And then he has to be able to present that knowledge to his employees in a way that they can understand while still communicating the necessary knowledge.
