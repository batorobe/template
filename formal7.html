                        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                        <p>Computer engineering, much like other science, technology, engineering and mathematical fields have similar ways of researching, presenting and analyzing information.  One of the main ways people present their research is through research papers.  This information is researched by computer engineers looking to complete their thesis or as a job working for an university.  These research papers are then published in journals like the Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences and the Journal of Computer Engineering & Information Technology. Research plays a crucial part in computer engineering.  Without research, nothing would ever advance, we would stay at the same level of technology.  All current technology used comes from research done by computer engineers, or some other form of engineering.  Research done by computer engineers has a significant impact on not only other researchers and scholars, but on our everyday lives.  Technology plays a crucial role in how researchers communicate their research to each other, the internet is used almost every time researchers want to talk about their research.  These journals are mainly used for researchers to communicate their findings to other researchers and professors.  Trade materials are used to communicate research done to the general population in a way that they can understand.  As evidenced above, the material is presented in a way that almost everyone can relate too.  Even the material that is slightly technologically advanced is spoon-fed to the readers.  Written methods of communication are very effective at explaining information through pictures and diagrams, something that oral communication has a hard time doing.  Another method of communication occurs from professors to their students.  Professors communicate material other people have researched to their students in a way that the students can understand, sometimes having to simplify complex ideas down to a way that communicates the knowledge needed.  Research also needs to be communicated to engineers currently working in the field.  Engineers currently working in the field, much like researchers need to be on the forefront of technological advances.  While it may not be as important to them, they need to be aware of what’s going on in the technical world around them.  Research, technology and communicate are all closely intertwined within the world of computer engineering.  Research is constantly ongoing, improving our computers and the technology we use.  Computer engineers present, analyze, build and use their knowledge in a multitude of ways, most of which were discussed above.  As a student in this discipline, I’ve learned a lot about what to expect after graduating and the crucial role that communication plays in relation to research done.
