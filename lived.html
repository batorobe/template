			<h3>Lived Experience</h3>
			<p>Flying through pixelated clouds and racing animated cars through ancient ruins have become some of my most vivid memories from childhood.  I also remember sliding down zip lines into a lush green forest and swimming through translucent blue water to find sunken pirate treasure.  The object that allowed me to do this was my Playstation. My first experience playing video games occurred while visiting one of my parent’s friends. While they talked about various topics, they sat me in front of a television with a strange gray box attached to it. Curiously I watched as someone put a disc into the box. Then I heard a sound soon to become familiar, the sound of the Playstation starting up. Then I remember watching in awe as a purple dragon flew across the screen and then landed on a grassy knoll to chase a white sheep around the screen. My first few minutes within the game were spent just walking around and figuring out how this game worked.  After those first few minutes I was hooked. As soon as I was finished roasting sheep and orcs with an orange breath of flame, we left my parents friends house and I began pleading for one of my own.  From playing Spyro the Dragon as a child to Madden NFL as an adult, my enjoyment of videogames has hardly waned. 
Growing up as a child with an active imagination, sitting bored in class, led me to come up with a multitude of bizarre and intricate game and computer application and hardware ideas.  For example, growing up I had ideas of virtual reality headsets that allowed you to immerse yourself deep within the game.  Occasionally I also drew sketches for weird game console designs and characters.  As I grew up my I realized that these dreams were a little out there, but that I could still be a part of the teams that had helped make my childhood. These ideas combined with my creative nature, stuck with me through high school and had a strong impact on what career path I would like to pursue during and after college.  I realized that I wanted to help future generations to experience what I had as a child, and that pursuing this major would help me accomplish that. The countless hours of fun I’ve had playing these games has definitely had an impact in the major I’m currently pursuing, Computer Engineering.  
	Pursuing a major as a computer engineer would allow me to accomplish all of the ideas I had come up with as an adolescent. My major is defined by the IEEE Computer Society as “a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software.” This major would not only allow me to possibly create the beautiful landscapes that entranced me in the first place, but also build the consoles that would play them.  So far, along my academic path, I’ve learned about the coding aspects of the work.  The parts that come together make video games and other applications work.  One of the important things I’ve learned about my major is that programming isn’t all fun, it’s more about collaboration with teammates to produce one solid piece of work. It’s also about being able to work independently well and producing the best piece of work you can.  This discipline teaches me study and work skills that I can use in the workplace after college.  My degree will allow me to create As I’m in my sophomore year now, I’ve started to switch and learn more about the hardware aspects of my major.  I’m currently taking classes which would help me in the future, logically think about how  to design and build computer boards.  My workload is also teaching me about circuitry within the computers, and how different voltages affect pieces of the hardware differently. As I advance my learning through college I will be able to do the things that I had thought as a child.  At the end of my learning career I expect to know how to create beautiful virtual landscapes for others to immerse themselves into. Computer engineering is a degree that isn’t just useful now, it’ll grow more useful as our society slowly evolves into a more technologically adept society.  You can see evidence of this evolution everywhere you look.  Almost everyone has a device in their pocket that is 10 times as strong the strongest computer 20 years ago.  We now have the technology such that everyone in the world can have access to a power thought impossible 50 years ago, all at a reasonable price. Everywhere you go you can see evidence of the work of a computer engineer.  In your phone, your shiny car, your high-priced Macbook, even the flashing red light as you drive home late at night. Back in a time when people got around by horse and buggy, almost no one could have guessed what a great impact computer engineers would have on the future, and the impact they will have on the future will only be stronger.  This is the kind of impact I want to have in my life.  The possibilities of the impact I may have are essentially endless. One way that I could possibly change the future is by designing the next iPhone. Phones are ubiquitous, I remember as a child I didn’t even think of owning a portable phone.  But nowadays even young children have a basic clamshell phone, a phone that used to be cutting edge only 5 years ago.  Maybe in the next five years, after I graduate, I could be part of a team that creates a virtual headset phone.  Maybe instead of a touchscreen we have a virtual headset that we can control with eye movements or by telling the headset what to do.  Or instead of having to talk loudly in a crowded area, maybe a microphone could be placed on the neck to allow you to not have to yell to get your point across in a busy area.  In addition to consumer technology, I could create advances in the medical field and help doctors and nurses save lives easier and quicker.  Currently we are having a shortage of some organs and body parts.  Computer engineering could help design and develop a better artificial heart, one that may even work better than the natural one we have.  Another thing that could be improved on are prosthetics,  some prosthetics are inaccurate in their movements, and hard to control; even the ones that work well are really expensive.  Perhaps I could come up with cheaper and more efficient ways to program and wire prosthetic limbs. These examples listed above are only a fraction of the things that I could achieve by pursuing my degree. Working with technology can help me enrich the lives of so many other people, much like it had enriched my life. Technology can change quickly and I want to be on the forefront of that change, helping others experience flying through space, or allowing them the experience the ability to throw a ball with the help of a prosthetic arm.  I want my degree to mean something, and maybe make a little money, so that’s why I chose computer engineering.
