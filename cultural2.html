			<h1>Background Analysis</h1>
			<p>The songs has lines like “He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes. Everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it” (Jaco) which talks about a person who is addicted to TV.   This line talks about how the media and technology is making us forget to think by doing the thinking for us.  Throughout the song he talks about how “...anything the box tells him to do, he does it” and “Anything it tells him to get, the shops and he cops it” (Jaco), Fiasco’s referencing the heavy influence violence and other inappropriate images on TV and other media forms have on people especially impressionable young people.  I also think he’s describing the media’s effect on how we spend our many and what we buy.  “When he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps.” (Jaco) refers to the fact that we have an unlimited amount of media and data to keep us occupied.  Personally, from when I wake up to when I go to bed I always have some form of electronic device to keep me updated with what’s going on in the world.  Fiasco raps about our society's addiction to technology, and the negative side effects that the addiction causes.  </p>
