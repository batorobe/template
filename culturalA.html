			<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
			<p>‘The Instrumental’, a song by Lupe Fiasco talks about a problem that is becoming more and more rampant throughout the world as we become more technologically advanced.  The song talks about the youths, and also adults, are becoming more and more obsessed with electronic media. While this song is very simple, the verses repeat and the hook is the same, it deals with something that almost everyone can relate too.  While the song mainly references television, all the things he says can easily be applied to a cell phone, the internet, social media and other forms of technology we use on a daily basis.  Computers are a part of almost everyone's life.  Virtually every American under 60 has used a computer, around 92% and nearly 87% say that computers have made their life better ("Survey shows widespread," 2000).   Almost everyone can agree that technology has brought a multitude of benefits to our society, but not everyone may know about all the negative side effects caused by an increase in technology.  From increased obesity rates to decreased social skills an increase in the use of technology could eventually be detrimental to our society.  Everyone knows that playing with mercury is bad for you, but many of our parents used to play with it a child.  Technology could be the same thing, in 100 years our society may look back and ask how we were so stupid to spend most of our waking hours in front of a screen.
