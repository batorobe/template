			<h1 align="center">A Common Addiction</h1>
			<p>‘The Instrumental’, a song by Lupe Fiasco talks about a problem that is becoming more and more rampant throughout the world as we become more technologically advanced.  The song talks about the youths, and also adults, are becoming more and more obsessed with electronic media. While this song is very simple, the verses repeat and the hook is the same, it deals with something that almost everyone can relate too.  While the song mainly references television, all the things he says can easily be applied to a cell phone, the internet, social media and other forms of technology we use on a daily basis.  Computers are a part of almost everyone's life.  Virtually every American under 60 has used a computer, around 92% and nearly 87% say that computers have made their life better ("Survey shows widespread," 2000).   Almost everyone can agree that technology has brought a multitude of benefits to our society, but not everyone may know about all the negative side effects caused by an increase in technology.  From increased obesity rates to decreased social skills an increase in the use of technology could eventually be detrimental to our society.  Everyone knows that playing with mercury is bad for you, but many of our parents used to play with it a child.  Technology could be the same thing, in 100 years our society may look back and ask how we were so stupid to spend most of our waking hours in front of a screen. </p>
			<p>The songs has lines like “He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes. Everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it” (Jaco) which talks about a person who is addicted to TV.   This line talks about how the media and technology is making us forget to think by doing the thinking for us.  Throughout the song he talks about how “...anything the box tells him to do, he does it” and “Anything it tells him to get, the shops and he cops it” (Jaco), Fiasco’s referencing the heavy influence violence and other inappropriate images on TV and other media forms have on people especially impressionable young people.  I also think he’s describing the media’s effect on how we spend our many and what we buy.  “When he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps.” (Jaco) refers to the fact that we have an unlimited amount of media and data to keep us occupied.  Personally, from when I wake up to when I go to bed I always have some form of electronic device to keep me updated with what’s going on in the world.  Fiasco raps about our society's addiction to technology, and the negative side effects that the addiction causes.  </p>
			<p>While technology has provided us with alot of advances, the recent elevated use of it has had detrimental effects on our society.  One of the side effects technology has had on our society is the lack of physical  activity and a decrease in the healthiness of the food we eat. Hundreds of years ago humans had to physically hunt down animals in order to eat, but as food becomes more readily available countries diets shift from lack of food towards an American-esque feast.   With more and more advances in technology come labor-saving machines.  These machines decrease the amount of physical activity we have to do in order to survive which in turn accelerates the rate at which obesity is rising.  Advances in technology also lead to more people being sedentary and less people being active outdoors.  For example, in South Korea TV viewing time has risen 72 percent from 1983 to 2001 (Choi, Cho, Park, Jang, Park, Kim & Lee, 2006).  Increased technology has also led to easier methods of transportation.  More and more people are buying care and less are using healthier forms of transportation like bikes and walking.  Adults aren't the only ones affected by the increases in technology, more and more kids are spending time playing online video games and using social networks at an alarming rate.  On average 8-18 year olds spend on average 7 hours and 38 minutes daily using entertainment media ("Generation m2: Media," ).  With kids spending their time using a lot of technology they don’t have the time to learn about healthy habits that they need.   The American Academy of Pediatrics tells us that children’s total entertainment media time should not exceed two hours daily, a limit that is on average being beaten by over twice as much time.  If we used technology to further people’s knowledge about healthier eating and exercise habits we could effectively decrease obesity rates across the world.  The increased use of technology has also increased the pace at which we live life at.  My parent’s and I’m sure my parents parents, have told their children that “patience is a virtue”.  A hundred years ago, it was common for it to take weeks to communicate with people halfway across the state.  Now we can send a text message and expect a reply within minutes.  This has led to a decrease in patience in everyone.  Everyone wants instant gratification and lack of patience and determination detrimental to our personal lives.  Another negative effect technology has had is on the declining writing skills of many children.  The high use of chatting shortcuts like “lol” and “omg” have caused the writing and speaking skills of children to decline dramatically.  Not only do kids become worse spellers, they won’t know how to properly use grammar or even be able to sign their own names on a check. The constant use of abbreviations and slang can lead us to forget how to properly use grammar and can degrade our abilities to speak formally ("Is technology harming," 2010).  Kids are relying more and more on digital forms of communication and they don’t have the time, or want to learn how to properly write.   The increase in technological communication affects our ability to express our ideas, especially if we needed to formally tell them to an employer or teacher.  The inability to properly express ourselves in the correct way does not help our society advance as a whole.  Technology also decreases our ability to deal with interpersonal conflicts.  It’s very easy to send people texts or Facebook messages when we’re angry with them instead of confronting them in the real world.  The anonymity the internet gives us allows some people to say things that they would never dream of in real life.  This lead to an increase in rudeness and aggression on online message boards such as the comments on a YouTube video.  This increase in the use of technology could eventually lead to people not even talking to each other face to face anymore, like in the movie Wall-E. Technology decreases the amount of time we spend in personal relationships.  With adults and even children being constantly wired we lose the connection we get from meeting and seeing people face to face. We lose out on facial expressions and other subtle nuances only used when talking to someone face to face.  Humans were built to have contact with other human beings and the increase in the use of technology doesn’t help us achieve that.  But there are ways that we can still use technology and lead healthy lives.
</p>
			<p>A solution to this issue would be to limit the amounts of technology that you use per day.  Most adults can easily remember a time when only the savviest of business men had cellphones.  A study done by researchers from the University of Glasgow revealed that almost half of the studies participants reported checking their email once an hour, while other checked their email 30 to 40 times an hour (Soong).  With this busy society we need to find a balance between work, leisure, and technology.  One suggestion would be to set a time, perhaps once a week where you don’t use the computer or your phone.  This provides a psychological recovery and prevents burnout from the overuse of technology.  It may even feel like a vacation to people constantly tethered to their communication devices.  If that seems too drastic try out a short period where you’re inaccessible.  Leave your phone and go for a peaceful walk, your life won’t self-destruct if you aren't able to communicate twenty-four seven and you can get some exercise.  For children parent’s can easily set timers and programs to limit their use of the Xbox, TV and internet.  This would cause them to hopefully spend more time with people in the real world and improve their personal skills.  A last idea is easy, learn moderation.  Learning moderation and having self-discipline is a skill that would serve anyone well and using it towards technology is a good thing.  Everyone knows that too much of anything isn’t a good thing and technology is no different.
</p>
			<p>A decrease in the use of technology will free up your time to go outside, read a book or do things that better yourself.  I’m not saying that technology can’t be used to better yourself,  what I’m saying is that a balanced life of both technology and interaction in the real world will lead to a better life.  A decreased use of technology will hopefully lower the obesity rates.  Many children eat a sizable portion of their daily calorie intake in front of the television or computer, and the calories they eat aren’t the healthiest.  A decrease in technology use would hopefully cause them to find other more active activities which would help curb the rising obesity rates.  Another possible effect would be that grades, communication skills, and focus would improve.  With kids not multitasking as much, using twitter, their phone, etc. at the same time they would be able to focus on the task at hand and be better able to communicate face to face, a necessary skill when interviewing for potential jobs.  Lastly time spent family and friends would increase.  The importance of spending time with your friends and family can not be understated, we learn so much from it.  One thing is that we’re taught how to listen and work together, spending time with each other forces us to take other people into consideration.  Another thing spending time with others improves is our communication skills, especially in young children.  Spending time with your children become are more trusting and can more easily bond with other people.  It also causes us to have more respect for each other.  Posting a faceless comment on the internet allows us to be as rude and hostile to other as we want.  But by spending time with other people causes us to be better and more well-rounded people.
</p>
			<p>In conclusion the song “The Instrumental” by Lupe Fiasco talks about a problem that we face daily, but can be easily solved.  Fiasco talks about an addiction to technology, this addiction isn’t world hunger, or aids, or some other epidemic that’s hard to solve.  All it takes is putting down your phone and detaching yourself from technology for a couple of hours a week.  The benefits from spending less time with technology are innumerous.  We could be more patient, healthy, and well-rounded people if we just took a break from the use of technology.  Technology isn’t a bad thing, but when used too much it can lead to bad things.
