			<h3>Scientific Article Analysis/h3>
			<p>The first scientific article I’ve chosen deals with the strengths and weakness of an metaheuristic algorithm used to determine a perfect state of harmony (Ahangaran, and Ramezani 1-7).  While computers are used for most of the calculations, a fair amount of math is still needed to write the programs.  For example, the following is an example of some of the unimodal and multimodal functions used to determine the speed of the algorithm.

These functions are one example of the sorts of tests run by computer engineers to determine the speed of the programs created.  Another scholarly paper deals with the differences between Ag, Silver, and graphene electrodes on Si, silicon, and PET substrates.  (Hu, Perello, Yun, and et al 42-47).  Like most scholarly papers the article begins with an abstract giving a sort of a summary about the data found, but not really.  An abstract talks more about the process they used to obtain their data as opposed to a quick summation of the data found.  These abstracts are very important to the communication of information.  They allow other researchers to quickly read a concise paragraph and decide whether or not the article pertains to their research.  The article also has a graphical abstract, something not normally done within research papers. 
The adage “a picture is worth a thousand words” applies to this as the graphical abstract adds another layer to the knowledge provided.  These articles as intended to be viewed between scholars and other researchers due to the level of material discussed.  A layman and engineering students would have a harder time discerning what is being discussed without a couple years of schooling.
