			<h3>Anticipated Effects</h3>
			<p>A decrease in the use of technology will free up your time to go outside, read a book or do things that better yourself.  I’m not saying that technology can’t be used to better yourself,  what I’m saying is that a balanced life of both technology and interaction in the real world will lead to a better life.  A decreased use of technology will hopefully lower the obesity rates.  Many children eat a sizable portion of their daily calorie intake in front of the television or computer, and the calories they eat aren’t the healthiest.  A decrease in technology use would hopefully cause them to find other more active activities which would help curb the rising obesity rates.  Another possible effect would be that grades, communication skills, and focus would improve.  With kids not multitasking as much, using twitter, their phone, etc. at the same time they would be able to focus on the task at hand and be better able to communicate face to face, a necessary skill when interviewing for potential jobs.  Lastly time spent family and friends would increase.  The importance of spending time with your friends and family can not be understated, we learn so much from it.  One thing is that we’re taught how to listen and work together, spending time with each other forces us to take other people into consideration.  Another thing spending time with others improves is our communication skills, especially in young children.  Spending time with your children become are more trusting and can more easily bond with other people.  It also causes us to have more respect for each other.  Posting a faceless comment on the internet allows us to be as rude and hostile to other as we want.  But by spending time with other people causes us to be better and more well-rounded people.
